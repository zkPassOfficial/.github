# zkPass

zkPass is oracle protocol that enables web private data to be verifiable. Built on top of zkTLS, composed of 3P-TLS and Hybrid ZK technologies, zkPass provides tools and applications for secure, verifiable data sharing with privacy and integrity assurances from any HTTPS website without requiring OAuth APIs.

zkPass allows users to selectively prove various types of data, such as legal identity, financial records, healthcare information, social interactions, gaming data, real-world assets, work experience, education, and skill certifications. These zero-knowledge proof computations are performed locally and securely, ensuring that sensitive personal data is not leaked or uploaded to third parties. They can be used for AI, DePIN, DID, lending, and other financial and non-financial applications.
